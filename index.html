                <p>In a world of superhuman beings, 
                    Saitama is a unique hero, he can defeat enemies 
                    with a single punch. But being just one hero in 
                    a world filled with them, his life is empty and 
                    hollow: he gets no respect from anyone, he displays 
                    a laidback attitude to everything and for the most 
                    part, he finds his overall hero life pointless... 
                    and worst of all, he lost his hair due to intense

                    yet extraordinary hero.</p>
